## Overview

In this exercise, we were working with Britta from the company Amazing Prime in preparation for a hackathon their company was sponsoring. For the hackathon, we wanted to present the competitors with clean, usuable data, so it was our job to extract, transform, and load the data in a cleaner, more structured manner. We used our knowledge of Python and Pandas to extract and clean the data, then used our knowldge of SQL to store the data.
